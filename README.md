# About Me
I am an Applied Statistician for the [Youth and Young Adult Depression and Suicide Prevention Lab](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/programs/ydsp), University of Michigan, and a Data Analyst for the [Data Science for Dynamic Intervention Decision Making Center](https://d3c.isr.umich.edu/) (d3c), Institute for Social Research. Upon moving to Boston, MA, I was fortunate to work in-person as an affiliate at the [Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html), Harvard University. 

I completed my M.S. in Biostatistics from University of Michigan School of Public Health in 2022, serving under a NSF AGEP-GRS grant fellowship as a graduate student researcher for Professor Bhramar Mukherjee. Prior to graduate school, I worked as an Analyst at Mathematica in health and disability policy research. I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Economics from Trinity College, CT.
