I am an Applied Statistician for the [Youth and Young Adult Depression and Suicide Prevention Lab](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/programs/ydsp), University of Michigan, and a Data Analyst for the [Data Science for Dynamic Intervention Decision Making Center](https://d3c.isr.umich.edu/) (d3c), Institute for Social Research. Since moving to Boston, MA, I am also fortunate to work in-person as an affiliate at the [Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html), Harvard University, with Professor Susan Murphy. Previously, I completed my M.S. in Biostatistics from University of Michigan, served under a NSF AGEP-GRS grant fellowship as a graduate student researcher for Professor Bhramar Mukherjee.

Before beginning graduate school, I worked for half a decade mainly in health and disability policy research. Aside from collaborating on research, hiking with my dog and gardening are some of my favorite ways to spend time.
